## 📈 Quantitative System Telemetry and KPI Tracking

### Performance Benchmarks and Efficiency 
The ultimate objective of refactoring an offline, generalized, Excel-based process into a highly available, specialized web platform lies in raw computational delivery:
- **Decreasing Latency Vectors:** By caching common Activity Masters directly in application memory (for example, utilizing an in-memory Redis cluster), we guarantee sub-second estimation calculations. This fundamentally shifts "estimation configuration" from a multi-day review cycle to real-time interactive adjustments during active PM meetings.
- **Material Precision Diagnostics:** The reduction in estimation errors is more than qualitative; it translates directly to capital expenditure (CapEx) metrics. Telemetry embedded in the application calculates the physical delta between material amounts computationally planned versus what procurement officers actually procured. 

### Operational Auditability and Compliance 
The **Structured Approval Workflow** outcome bridges the gap between ad-hoc engineering management and ISO-standard Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP):
- **Deterministic Approvals:** Legacy workflows frequently suffer from fragmented email authorization spanning multiple departments. A centralized database engine managing these finite authorization transitions provides unparalleled access visibility and definitive historical audits, which acts as the foundational requirement for larger-scale financial compliance.
