## 🛠️ Stack Rationale & Continuous Deployment

### The Universal Language Paradigm
Adopting Full-Stack JavaScript/TypeScript (React and Node.js) allows the deployment of a universal language paradigm. This drastically reduces the context-switching load for solo developers/teams, allowing entities models, API interfaces, and validation schemas to be shared identically across both client and server domains via a monorepo setup (e.g., using Nx or Turborepo).

### Node.js for High I/O Bound Workloads
Because this system's primary constraint involves heavy queries to coefficient databases rather than CPU-intensive algorithmic crunches (like video rendering), Node.js's inherently asynchronous, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is an optimal, highly performant choice for this specific domain logic.

### Relational Rigidity with PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is universally hailed as the most advanced open-source relational database. For an application where transactional safety determines physical dollars executing on a construction site, PostgreSQL provides us with absolute ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees while also offering native JSON/JSONB support if unstructured logging data is necessary in the future.
