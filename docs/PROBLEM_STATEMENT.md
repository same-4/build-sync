# Problem Statement

## 1. Current Challenges in Construction Resource Planning

Small and mid-sized construction companies face persistent inefficiencies in managing materials, manpower, and procurement during project execution. In most cases, planning and tracking activities are handled using a combination of Excel spreadsheets, paper records, and informal communication tools.

Common problems observed include:

- Project schedules and material requirements are maintained separately, with no direct linkage between planned activities and required resources.
- Material estimation depends heavily on individual experience rather than structured, repeatable data.
- Frequent over-ordering or under-ordering of materials, leading to wastage or site-level shortages.
- Poor alignment between procurement timing and actual project schedules.
- Delays caused by manual approvals and unstructured coordination between engineers, project managers, and purchase teams.
- Limited visibility into what materials were planned, ordered, received, and consumed at the site.

As schedules change during execution, these manual systems struggle to adapt, resulting in reactive decision-making and loss of control over cost and timelines.

## 2. Gaps in Existing Tools and Practices

While scheduling tools such as Primavera or MS Project are commonly used, they primarily focus on time-based planning and operate in isolation from procurement and inventory workflows. Procurement and inventory management are typically handled using separate spreadsheets or basic accounting systems.

This separation creates operational gaps such as:

- Manual translation of schedule data into material requests and purchase plans.
- Repeated data entry across disconnected tools.
- Inconsistent or outdated information being used for procurement decisions.
- Lack of traceability between scheduled work, purchased materials, and on-site consumption
